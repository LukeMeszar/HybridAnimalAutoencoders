# Processing

This section of the project contains relevant matlab scripts and functions for preprocessing of the data sets. 

# Contents
Each of the matlab scripts ending in _data are responsible for the preprocessing of individual datasets. These are published into a structure for pytorch's dataloader.
Supplemental matlab functions provide simple CV-based segmentation of the images, while pre-defined segmentations of objects were used when possible.
